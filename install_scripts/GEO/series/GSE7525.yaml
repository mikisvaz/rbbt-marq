:description: |-
  We examined the mating response of three yeast species, by subjecting a-type cells from each of them to alpha-factor (6uM). The expression of cells before and after (60min) addition of alpha-factor were compared using S. cerevisiae cDNA microarrays. In addition, we verified our results with a true mating experiment: the expression of a-type and alpha-type cells from S. cerevisiae were compared before and after mixing them for 90 minutes (i.e. allowing them to mate).
