:description: "GSM306248: S. cerevisiae was grown on YEPD. Wild type and msg5 yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 \xC2\xB0C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 \xC2\xB0C for 4hours. After  4 hours of growth cells were collected, frozen at -80 \xC2\xB0C and processed for RNA extraction.\n\
  GSM306249: msg5 yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 \xC2\xB0C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 \xC2\xB0C for 4hours. After 4 hours the culture was divided into two parts. One was treated with alpha factor and the other part was allow to grow without any treatment. After 90 minutes of treatment, both cultures of cells were collected, frozen at -80 \xC2\xB0C and processed for RNA extraction."
