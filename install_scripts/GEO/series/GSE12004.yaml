:description: Oxygen lack of various severity can force many organisms to enter into recoverable hypometabolic states. To better understand how organisms cope with oxygen deprivation, our lab had previously shown that when challenged with anoxia, both the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and embryos of the zebrafish Danio rerio enter into suspended animation, where all life processes that can be observed by light microscopy reversibly halt, pending restoration of oxygen. Here, we show that both sporulating and vegetative cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also enter into a similar state of suspended animation when made anoxic on a non-fermentable carbon source. Transcriptional profiling using cDNA microarrays shows upregulation of aerobic metabolism genes in carbon monoxide (CO)-induced anoxia, but not nitrogen (N2) gas-induced anoxia, consistent with the known oxygen-mimetic effects of CO.  Our results lead us to propose a model for oxygen-regulated gene expression in yeast where two oxygen-sensitive mechanisms operate simultaneously, such that treatment with N2 results in both mechanisms signaling a lack of oxygen, while treatment with CO results in one sensing mechanism signaling a lack of oxygen, while the other signals an abundance of oxygen.
