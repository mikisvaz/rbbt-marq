:title: "Functional Genomic Analysis of Commercial Baker\xE2\x80\x99s Yeast during Initial Stages of Model Dough-Fermentation"
:description: "Gene expression profiles of baker\xE2\x80\x99s yeast during initial dough-fermentation were investigated using liquid fermentation media to obtain insights at the molecular level into rapid adaptation mechanisms of baker\xE2\x80\x99s yeast. Results showed that onset of fermentation caused drastic changes in gene expression profiles within 15 min. Genes involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were down-regulated and genes involved in glycolysis were up-regulated, indicating a metabolic shift from respiration to fermentation. Genes involved in ethanol production (PDC genes and ADH1), in glycerol synthesis (GPD1 and HOR2), and in low-affinity hexose transporters (HXT1 and HXT3) were up-regulated at the beginning of model dough-fermentation. Among genes up-regulated at 15 min, several genes classified as transcription were down-regulated within 30 min. These down-regulated genes are involved in messenger RNA splicing and ribosomal protein biogenesis, in zinc finger transcription factor proteins, and in transcriptional regulator (SRB8, MIG1). In contrast, genes involved in amino acid metabolism and in vitamin metabolism, such as arginine biosynthesis, riboflavin biosynthesis, and thiamin biosynthesis, were subsequently up-regulated after 30 min. Interestingly, the genes involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway were also subsequently up-regulated. Our study presents the first overall description of the transcriptional response of baker\xE2\x80\x99s yeast during dough-fermentation, and will thus help clarify genomic responses to various stresses during commercial fermentation processes.\n\
