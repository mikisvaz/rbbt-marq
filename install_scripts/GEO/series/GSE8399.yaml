:description: |-
  The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Zn(II)2Cys6 zinc cluster transcription factor War1, mediates part of the transcriptional response to weak organic acids such as sorbate or benzoate.  We identified gain-of function alleles of War1 that map to a region in the center of the molecule conserved in War1 related proteins from other fungi. Independent of weak acids, they increase levels of plasma membrane ABC transporter Pdr12, the main target gene of War1. In the experiment, the constitutive War1 allele K762R was expressed from the GAL1 promoter. RNA was extracted after one hour induction of the GAL1 promoter by Galactose to exclude indirect effects of the constitutive allele.
