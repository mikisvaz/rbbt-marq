:description: "Transrepression mediated by PPARg and LXRs agonists (GW7845 and GW3965) in primary macrophages stimulated with LPS or poly I:C. Thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were isolated from mice by peritoneal lavage 3 days following peritoneal injection of 2.5 ml 3% thioglycollate (DIFCO). Cells were plated in RPMI medium 1640 and 10% fetal bovine serum, washed after 5 h the medium was removed and cells were fed with fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were treated with LPS (Sigma) a concentration of 100 ng/ml or poly I:C (100 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of receptor-specific agonists for PPAR\xCE\xB3 (GW7845) or LXR (GW3965) at 1 \xC2\xB5M concentrations. Results suggest signal-dependent nuclear receptors transrepression pathways.\n\
