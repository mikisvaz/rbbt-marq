:title: Histone H2B^30-37
:description: |-
  Histone H2B was mutated to give H2B^30-37.  Total RNA from three replicate cultures of wild-type and mutant was isolated and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes regulated by H2B HBR domain.
