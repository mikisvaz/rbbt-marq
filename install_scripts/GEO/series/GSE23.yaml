:title: cdc15 block-release
:description: |-
  Yeast cells were blocked in telophase using a cdc15-2 temperature senstive mutant at restrictive temperature. The culture was then shifted to permissive temperature (25oC), and released into the cell cycle. Samples were then taken during the course of almost three full cell cycles.
