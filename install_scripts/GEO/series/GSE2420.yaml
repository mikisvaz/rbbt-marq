:title: 50 uM AFB_time course
:description: |-
  RNA isolated from the cultures treated with 0 and 50 micromolar AFB1 at 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min was used for microarray experiments. For each array hybridization experiment, RNAs from the treated sample and its corresponding time-matched control were co-hybridized to arrays and respectively quantified in different channels.  A dye swap strategy was used to eliminate the dye bias.
