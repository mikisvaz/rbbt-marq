:title: Rapid tRNA decay can result from lack of non-essential modifications
:description: |-
  A microarray tiling approach was utilized to assay tRNA modifications by comparing hybridization affinity of tRNA-modification mutants to wild-type across all annotated yeast tRNAs.
  Keywords: Assaying noncoding RNA modifications
