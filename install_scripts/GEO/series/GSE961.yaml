:description: "S. cerevisiae was grown on YEPD. For Congo Red experiments, yest cells were grown overnight at 24 \xC2\xB0C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 \xC2\xB0C for 2h 30min. Next, culture was divided into two parts. One continues growing under same conditions (non-treated culture) while the other was supplemented with Congo Red to a final concentration of 30 \xCE\xBCg/ml. Cells were collected at 2hours of growth, frozen at -80 \xC2\xB0C and processed for RNA extraction.\n\
