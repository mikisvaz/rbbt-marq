:description: "S. cerevisiae was grown on YEPD. For Zymolyase experiments, yeast cells were grown overnight at 24 \xC2\xB0C to an optical density 0.8 - 1 (A600). The culture was refreshed to 0.2 O.D and grown at 24 \xC2\xB0C for 2h 30min. Next, culture was divided into two parts. One continues growing under same conditions (non-treated culture) while the other was supplemented with 5units/ml Zymolyase 100T . Cells were collected at 2 hours of growth, frozen at -80 \xC2\xB0C and processed for RNA extraction.\n\
