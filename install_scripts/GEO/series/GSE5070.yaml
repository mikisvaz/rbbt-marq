  The role of the S. cerevisiae Yap4 transcription factor in the response to hyperosmolarity was investigated in two ways. Firstly, to assess the overall response of the yap4 deleted strain genome wide analysis upon a mild upshift in osmolarity was compared to the same response in the wt strain. Secondly, in order to identify genes whose osmo-expression is differentially regulated in the mutant strain (ie potential Yap4 target genes) the relative abundance of cDNAs of the wt and yap4 mutant strain obtained upon an osmotic upshift were directly compared by microarray analysis.
