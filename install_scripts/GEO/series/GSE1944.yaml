:title: Genome-wide binding of Fhl1 and Ifh1 +/- Rapamycin
:description: "Array design\n\
  -Platform: amino-silane coated glass slides (GAPS II, Corning)\n\
  -S. cerevisiae intergenic regions amplified from S288C genomic DNA (ResGen) using the intergenic region primer oligonucleotides (ResGen) (Harismendy et al. EMBO J. 22(18): 4738-4747, 2003). The primers allow the amplification of the sequence located on either side of elements such as open reading frames, tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs, Ty elements, solo \xCE\xB4, etc. A complete description of the primers can be obtained on the web site (ftp://ftp.resgen.com/pub/genepairs/yeast_intergenic).\n\
  -The PCR products were purified and spotted using an automated arrayer (MicroGrid II, BioRobotics)\n\n\
  Experiment design\n\
  -Type of experiment: genome wide binding analysis\n\
  -Experimental factor: genotype (Wild-Type, Fhl1-myc, Ifh1-myc); drug (rapamycin)\n\
  -Number of hybridization performed in the experiment: 15 (four conditions with three to five biological replicates each)\n\
  -Reference used for each condition: ChIP from the wild-type strain\n\
  -Quality control: one dye-swap per condition\n\
  Samples used, extract preparation and labeling\n\
  -The origin of the biological sample:\n\
  o\tSpecies: S. cerevisiae\n\
  o\tCell type: (1) W303; (2) W303+IFH1-13myc-TRP1MX6;(3) W303+FHL1-13myc-HIS3MX6.\n\
  -Growth conditions: log phase (2x107/mL) at 30\xC2\xBAC in YPD medium; when indicated rapamycin was added at the final concentration of 200 ng/mL for 90 min.\n\
  -Cross-linking for 30 min at 30\xC2\xBAC\n\
  -Chromatin immunoprecipitation: Dynabeads M280 coupled to sheep anti-mouse IgG or sheep anti-rabbit IgG and mouse monoclonal antibodies against the myc epitope (culture supernatant of 9E10) were used for immunoprecipitation according to standard techniques.\n\
  -Labeling protocol(s): each IP was blunt-ended, ligated to linker DNA, then subjected to Ligation Mediated (LM)-PCR in the presence of amino-allyl dUTP. Labeling was performed for 1 hour at room temperature in the presence of NHS-ester Cy3 or Cy5 in 0.1 M Sodium Carbonate. The labeling reaction was stopped with 2 M Hydroxylamine and the labeled DNA purified.\n\
  Hybridization procedures and parameters\n\
  -Standard protocols were used\n\
  Measurement data and specifications\n\
  -Software for scanning: GenePix Pro 4.0 (Axon Instruments, Inc.)\n\
  -Scanner: GenePix 4000A (Axon Instruments, Inc.)\n\
