  We examined the gene expression
  changes resulting from the evolution of resistance in
  experimental populations of the yeast Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae subjected to two antifungal drugs, fluconazole
  (FLC) and amphotericin B (AmB). Fluconazole resistance may involve increased efflux or changes in sterol metabolism, while AmB resistance
  generally involves changes in sterol metabolism; for all of
  these types of resistance, the gene expression changes are
  extensive. The goal of these experiments was to test
  whether failure of gene expression changes all downstream
  of the original mutation for drug resistance would affect
  the ability of a mutant cell to evolve and/or to support a
  drug-resistant phenotype.
