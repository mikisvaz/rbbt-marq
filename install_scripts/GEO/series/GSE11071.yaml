:description: |-
  Chemostat evolution experiment C1 under glucose-limited condition at 30C.  Gene Expression profiles of adaptive clones M1-M5 in evolved conditions compared with original parents.
  An all pairs experiment design type is where all labeled extracts are compared to every other labeled extract.
  Genotype: Evolved clones.  The genotype is not necessarily complete.
  Keywords: all_pairs
:title: C1 evolved adaptive clones M1-M5
