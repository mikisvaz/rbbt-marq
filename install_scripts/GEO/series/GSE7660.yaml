  The Target Of Rapamycin (TOR) protein is a Ser/Thr kinase that functions in two distinct multiprotein complexes: TORC1 and TORC2. These conserved complexes regulate many different aspects of cell growth in response to intra- and extracellular cues. Here we report the first bona fide substrate of yeast TORC1: the AGC-kinase Sch9. Six amino acids in the c-terminus of Sch9 are directly phosphorylated by TORC1. Phosphorylation of these residues is lost upon rapamycin-treatment as well as carbon- or nitrogen-starvation and transiently reduced following application of osmotic, oxidative or thermal stress. TORC1-dependent phosphorylation is required for Sch9 activity and replacement of residues phosphorylated by TORC1 with Asp/Glu renders Sch9 activity TORC1-independent. Sch9 is required for TORC1 to properly regulate ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation and entry into G0 phase, but not expression of Gln3-dependent genes. Our results suggest that Sch9 functions analogously to the mammalian TORC1 substrate S6K1 rather than the mTORC2 substrate PKB/Akt.
