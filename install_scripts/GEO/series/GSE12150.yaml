:title: Expression data from yeast with Anc1p or without under basal or MMS exposed conditions
:description: |-
  We are investigating the transcriptional response of Anc1 deficient yeast under basal and MMS exposed conditions
  We used microarrays to detail the global programme of gene expression underlying the MMS response in WT and Anc1 deficient yeast
