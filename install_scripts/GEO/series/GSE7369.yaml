  We transcriptional profiled four transcription factor knockout strains in S288C background growing in YNB media + 2% glucose to understand the link between mRNA levels and our measured C13 fluxes of amino acid biosynthesis.  We conducted this analysis as a follow up to our work on the Gcn4p transcription factor.
