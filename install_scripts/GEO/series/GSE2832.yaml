:title: Improved statistical analysis of budding yeast TAG microarrays
:description: |-
  Yeast knockout collection TAG microarrays are an emergent platform for rapid, genome-wide functional characterization of yeast genes. We describe a method for analyzing two-color array data to efficiently represent differential knockout strain representation across two experimental conditions. Using a fully defined spike-in pool, we show that the sensitivity and specificity of this method exceed typical current approaches.
